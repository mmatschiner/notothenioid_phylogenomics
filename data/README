This directory contains data for phylogenetic analysis of Notothenioid fish species.

There are amino acid and nucleotide sequences for 266 single-copy gene families for 41 species.  The species are listed in species.tab, and include
10 outgroups and 31 Notothenioid species, 24 sequenced at Sanger and 7 others with public whole genome sequences.

The gene annotations are generated by BUSCO, and we have included all 266 families for which each of BUSCO finds a complete single copy in every
genome.  These are certainly biased towards more conserved genes, but given that the corresponding coding DNA sequences are also available there should be
strong phylogenetic signal.

The files in the directory are:

    6320 Apr  4 17:13 species.tab			// species table giving id codes used for species and other information
 1341440 Apr  4 16:53 notothen-phylo-families.faa.tar	// tarfile of directory FAA containing gzipped fasta files per family of amino-acid sequences
 2734080 Apr  4 16:53 notothen-phylo-families.fna.tar	// tarfile of directory FNA containing gzipped fasta files per family of amino-acid sequences
